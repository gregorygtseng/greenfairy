      <h3> What is a Climate Score? </h3>
      <p> Climate Counts uses a 0-to-100 point scale and 22 criteria to determine if companies have        
        <strong>MEASURED</strong> their climate "footprint",
        <strong>REDUCED</strong> their impact on global warming,
        <strong>SUPPORTED</strong> progressive climate legislation,
        and publicly <strong>DISCLOSED</strong> their climate actions
